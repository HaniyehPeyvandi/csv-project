# Csv_Project


Csv application is a responsive React application supporting different devices with a wide variety of screen sizes in which user can upload a csv file by choosing it from browsing file explorer or just drag and drop.
When the user clicks on the show data button, the app validates the csv file. If the file is okay, user will be navigated to the users page. In the users page, the content of the csv file will be displayed in a table. The table has pagination and the user can move between pages.
This application also has a great search feature that the user enters the name and it will trace the whole rows to find the result among first name or last name column and then shows the result in a different color and font weight.
In order to test this application, a sample csv file is available in the csv_sample folder.
